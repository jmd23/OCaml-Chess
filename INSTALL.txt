Our project so far does not use any external libraries or packages. Simply 
follow the directions in the textbook to install OPAM and create a switch, with
the OCaml compiler. (Textbook Link: https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html)

Navigate to the main directory, then run make build, followed by make play, 
to see the user interface for the game. You will enter moves such as "e2 e4"
to move the pieces, or "quit" to exit the game.
